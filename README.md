The code starts off by giving the user 2 cards with a random number assigned to each of them. The user is then told their total score from these 2 cards. Then, the user is asked if
they want to draw another card. Typying "yes" will give the user anotehr random card and print out their new score. The code will keep asking the user if they want a new card until the 
user either types "no" or if the user has exceeded the score of 21. 

Once the user stops drawing cards, then the dealer will draw cards. If the dealer draws a card and goes over 21, the user automatically wins. 
If the dealer stops drawing cards then the code will compare the user's total score to the dealer's total score. Whoever has the highest score under 21 wins.
If both scores are the same, the game will result in a tie.
